# Horiseon

## Objective
* Every week, I was given a specific homework to work on.

* This week, I was tasked to fix a certain coding mistake on the given HTML and CSS files.

* The HTML have certain issues with ID and alt problems.

* The CSS is missing the comment, so I make other harder to read.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:
* WHEN I view the source code - THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the image elements - THEN I find accessible alt attributes

* WHEN I view the heading attributes - THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
